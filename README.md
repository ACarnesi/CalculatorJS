# Summary 
This is a project I started in order to improve my javascript and get some hands on experience with parsing. 

This is just a simple calculator that reads an infix expression provided in the input text, converts the infix expression to postfix, and then evalutes the postfix expression. 

Currently, it only supports basic opperations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It should be built in a way to easily extend new opperators if desired. 

# TODOs
- [ ] Add event listeners for keyboard presses
  - The listeners should not function while the input field is in focus
- [ ] Find a better way to incoporate neagtives 
- [ ] Update UI to make more sense
- [ ] Validate symbols and throw error if an unsupported symbol is used
